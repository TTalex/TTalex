# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there

I'm Alex, a dev based in Paris, France.

<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12850311?s=200&v=4" width="30" height="30"> I am the tech lead at [FabMob](https://github.com/fabmob), ping me if you want to contribute on cool open source projects around mobility challenges.

ðŸŒ™ In my spare time, I usually try to create silly stuff on cool technologies, for example:

- A kubernetes cluster exposing an API that "cleans" your input (removes all content) in a overcomplicated way
- A golang program that helps you convert unusual units, for example your weight in meters of sausage
- A calculator that approximates the results it gives you when it gets tired at the end of the day
- An app that finds a tree in Paris planted near your date of birth
