# Hey there

I'm Alex, a dev based in Paris, France.

Welcome to my Github where I upload the sources of my (more than often) silly projects and random web games.

I usually try to create unserious stuff on cool technologies, for example:

- A kubernetes cluster exposing an API that "cleans" your input (removes all content) in a overcomplicated way
- A golang program that helps you convert unusual units, for example your weight in meters of sausage
- A calculator that approximates the results it gives you when it gets tired at the end of the day
- An app that finds a tree in Paris planted near your date of birth
